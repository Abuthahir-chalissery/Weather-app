# 🌦️ Weather App

## 🌐 Project Overview
The **Weather App** is a sleek and modern web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It leverages the **Weather API** to provide real-time weather updates for any location. This project is designed to enhance my skills in JavaScript and Tailwind CSS, focusing on interactivity and responsive design.
